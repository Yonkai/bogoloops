# BogoLoops
The basic purpose of this website is to show how fast your browser claims to  do absolutely nothing, based on the concept of [BogoMips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BogoMips). The time recording is rough because of timing attack mitigation efforts ([Spectre](https://meltdownattack.com/)).
